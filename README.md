# breast-cancer-attributes-classification

Getting to know more about cancer classification. Cancer classifcation model based on column attributes.

1. **Prediction of Breast Cancer using SVM with 99% accuracy** - create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer
2. **Exploring Breast Cancer Data set** - visualising and exploring Breast Cancer data set to predict cancer
3. **Building a Simple Machine Learning Model on Breast Cancer Data** - building various models for cancer prediction
